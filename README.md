# Detection of Cerebral Hemorrhages With Supervised Learning
--- 

## Data set
- Size: 50,000 instances from MRI images
- cleansed into csv format
- 618 features â€“ see Data set Readme in *./data*
- Positives/Negatives: 25018/24982
	- accuracy is an okay metric for this case since the data is balanced

## Methods

Scikit-learn was used to implement all of the classifiers above except Logistic Regression using the built-in models. Keras was used to create a second custom neural network for evaluation. 

To implement each classifier, the input data was first loaded into a Jupyter notebook and split up 70%/30% for the training/testing sets. To improve the performance of the classifiers, the data was then feature-scaled using Scikit-learn's StandardScaler. Afterward, the dimensionality of the data was reduced using a Truncated SVD algorithm to reduce the amount of data fed into each classifier and improve performance

### Development Environment

Development was completed using Google Colaboratory, which enables editing of Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. This was chosen because of its greater memory (12GB) and also for its GPU accelerated runtime. Since Tensorflow was selected as the backend for Keras, the library could take advantage of this runtime to improve performance.
